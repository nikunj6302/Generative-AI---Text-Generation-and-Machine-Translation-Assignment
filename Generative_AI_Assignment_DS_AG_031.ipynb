    "\n",
    "Generative AI is a class of artificial intelligence models that learn patterns from existing data and generate new content such as text, images, audio, video, and code. Unlike traditional AI systems that focus on prediction or classification, generative AI can create original outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:** Healthcare (medical reports, drug discovery), Education (content creation, tutoring), Media (story writing, music), Business (chatbots, marketing), Software Development (code generation), Finance (reports, simulations)."

    "**Role of probabilistic modeling in generative models and difference from discriminative models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models use probabilistic modeling to learn the underlying data distribution. They estimate how likely data points are and can generate new samples. Generative models learn joint probability P(X, Y) or P(X), while discriminative models learn conditional probability P(Y|X). Generative models can create data, whereas discriminative models focus on prediction."
